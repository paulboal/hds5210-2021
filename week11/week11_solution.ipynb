You can do that using datetime functions if you want, but you'll notice that the date in this file is a string formatted YYYY-MM-DD-HH:mm:ss, so it's probably easier just to pull out the first 10 characters of the string instead.  `meetings['startTime'].str[0:10]`\n",

A hand tip on this is that you can set values for some rows in a data frame using `meetings.loc[row_filter,'Column Name'] = 'Value'` if you've created a `row_filter` as we discussed in prior weeks.\n",
